# ElonTweetsTeslaStock
If you follow technology, entrepreneurship, or space exploration, you more recently may have been introduced to Tesla or its CEO Elon Musk. Following Musk in the news, you might have noticed the pioneering capitalist tweets out whatever comes to his mind at a given moment, regarding his own companies, geo-politics, cryptocurrencies, and the occasional witty meme. Some of these tweets have come back to bite him in the form of large sellouts of Tesla shares. A fortune.com article shared that one single tweet from Musk on November 6, 2021, about selling a portion of his Tesla shares sent Tesla stock price plummeting by 7.3% in one day (Vercoe, 2021).

## General Information
- For our analysis, we began focusing towards attempting to build a relationship between the number of tweets Musk had on a specific day, or what exactly Elon tweeted, and Tesla’s stock price. 
- We want to know if there is a specific relationship between Elon’s tweets and the stock price of his company. If we are able to find a specific relationship, we can use that when buying/selling Tesla stock. We have broke our baseline analysis question down into more in depth questions below: 

- Did the volume of the amount of stock traded each day increase/decrease drastically when Elon tweeted? 

- What is the average change in stock price on a day when Elon Tweets? 

- Were there any other factors to take into consideration when looking at the stock during these tweet times? 

- What are the most used words that Elon tweets that causes stock price to drastically change the most? 

Is there a specific relationship between Elon Musk’s tweets and the stock price?
